# Sender Policy Framework

from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework)

Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is a simple email-validation system designed to
detect email spoofing by providing a mechanism to allow receiving mail
exchangers to check that incoming mail from a domain comes from a host
authorized by that domain's administrators.[1] The list of authorized sending
hosts for a domain is published in the Domain Name System (DNS) records for that
domain in the form of a specially formatted TXT record. Email spam and phishing
often use forged "from" addresses, so publishing and checking SPF records can be
considered anti-spam techniques.

IETF publication RFC 7208 dated April 2014 defines Sender Policy Framework as
"proposed standard".
