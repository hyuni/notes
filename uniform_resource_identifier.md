#URI

[todo]

different URI and URL and URN?

## URL v URI
... Uniform Resource Locators (`URL`s), the wonderful strings that tell your web
browser how to fetch resources from the World Wide Web. They are a subclass of
the full set of possible Uniform Resource Identifiers (`URI`s); specifically,
they are `URI`s constructed so that they give instructions for fetching a
document, instead of serving only as an identifier.
