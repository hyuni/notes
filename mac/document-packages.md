# Document Package

If your document file formats are getting too complex to manage because of
several disparate types of data, you might consider adopting a package format
for your documents. Document packages give the illusion of a single document to
users but provide you with flexibility in how you store the document data
internally. Especially if you use several different types of standard data
formats, such as JPEG, GIF, or XML, document packages make accessing and
managing that data much easier.
