# Keychain

In macOS, keychain files are stored in `~/Library/Keychains/`,
`/Library/Keychains/`, and `/Network/Library/Keychains/`, and the Keychain
Access GUI application is located in the Utilities folder in the `Applications`
folder. It is free, open source software released under the terms of the
APSL. The command line equivalent of Keychain Access is `/usr/bin/security`.
