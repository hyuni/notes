# Swift and XCode


- XCode 8.3
  - Swift 3.1
- XCode 9,
  - Swift 3 and 4
  - Swift 4 compiler

- When the Swift 4 compiler is working with Swift 3 code, it identifies its
language version as 3.2. As a result, you can use conditional compilation
blocks like #if swift(>=3.2) to write code thatâ€™s compatible with multiple
versions of the Swift compiler.
