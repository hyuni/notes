# Range
A range is an interval of values, defined by its lower and upper bounds. You create ranges with the two range operators: `..<` for half-open ranges that donâ€™t include their upper bound, and `...` for closed ranges that include both bounds:

```swift
// 0 to 9, 10 is not included
let singleDigitNumbers = 0..<10

// "z" is included
let lowercaseLetters = Character("a")...Character("z")
```
