# Rx Swift

RxSwift is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based code by using
observable sequences and functional style operators, allowing for parameterized
execution via schedulers.

RxSwift, in its essence, simplifies developing asynchronous programs by allowing
your code to react to new data and process it in sequential, isolated manner.
