# Range Replacable Collection

A collection that supports replacement of an arbitrary subrange of elements with
the elements of another collection.

Range-replaceable collections provide operations that insert and remove
elements. For example, you can add elements to an array of strings by calling
any of the inserting or appending operations that the `RangeReplaceableCollection`
protocol defines.
