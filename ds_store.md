# ds_store

In the Apple macOS operating system, .DS_Store is a file that stores custom
attributes of its containing folder, such as the position of icons or the choice
of a background image.[1] The name is an abbreviation of Desktop Services
Store,[2] reflecting its purpose. It is created and maintained by the Finder
application in every folder, and has functions similar to the file desktop.ini
in Microsoft Windows. Starting with a full stop (period) character, it is hidden
in Finder and many Unix utilities. Its internal structure is proprietary.[3]
