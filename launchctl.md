`launchctl` interfaces with `launchd` to load, unload daemons/agents and
generally control `launchd`. `launchctl` supports taking subcommands on the command
line, interactively or even redirected from standard input.
These commands can be stored in `$HOME/.launchd.conf` or `/etc/launchd.conf` to be
read at the time `launchd` starts.
