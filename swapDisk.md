# Swap Disk

Same thing as [Paging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paging).

Paging is a memory management scheme where memory is moved between disk and RAM. Paging is expensive in that you have to do IO to make it happen. 
Paging is useful in virtual memory implementations in that your your virtual memory can exceed your physical memory by paging between a swap disk.
