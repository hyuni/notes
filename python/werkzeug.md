Werkzeug is a WSGI utility library for Python. It's widely used and BSD
licensed.

WSGI itself is a protocol or convention that ensures that your web application
can speak with the webserver and more importantly that web applications work
nicely together.

## WSGI

WSGI is the Web Server Gateway Interface. It is a specification that describes
how a web server communicates with web applications, and how web applications
can be chained together to process one request.

WSGI is a Python standard described in detail in PEP 3333.
