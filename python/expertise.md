# Expert Level Python

according to some guy on youtube James Powell  
PyData Seattle 7/5/2017  
he claims that python is a protocol oriented language  
python is quite simple, runs top to bottom  linearly  
almost every statement you see is executable runtime code  



## data model methods
google it   
`__method__`  
a means by which you can implement some protocol  
depends on the object itself  

we get some top level syntax or top level function to implement that protocol

`__call__`

## Three patterns to grok for OOP Python

### protocol view
### builtin inheritance model, where you go to look for things on an object
### caveats around how OOP works

# Metaclasses
seen in the django ORM  

leading us to 3 other features that are more interesting

1. decorators
1. generators
1. context managers


`__build_class__` todo grok

you can hook into everything. importing modules, creating classes ...
