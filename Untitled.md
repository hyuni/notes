`NSFetchedResultsController`

You use a fetched results controller to efficiently manage the results returned from a Core Data fetch request to provide data for a UITableView object.

`NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate`

An instance of NSFetchedResultsController uses methods in this protocol to notify its delegate that the controllerâ€™s fetch results have been changed due to an add, remove, move, or update operations.



`NSFetchRequestResult`

`NSPredicate`

The NSPredicate class is used to define logical conditions used to constrain a search either for a fetch or for in-memory filtering.
