# Object files 
* come in four forms: 

## relocatable
Relocatable object files contain code and data that can be statically linked
at compile time with other relocatable object files in order to create an
executable.

## executable
Executable object files are ready to be loaded into memory and executed. 

## shared
Shared object files are a special version of relocatable object files 

## bundle. 
* on macOS, this filetype is typically used for plugins.
