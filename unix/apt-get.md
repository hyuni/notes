# `apt-get`

## `update`
`apt-get update` updates the list of available packages and their versions, but
it does not install or upgrade any packages.

## `upgrade`
`apt-get upgrade` actually installs newer versions of the packages you have.
After updating the lists, the package manager knows about available updates for
the software you have installed. This is why you first want to update.
