## Self vs self

`Self` vs `self` in Swift involve subtle little differences.  

`Self` refers to a type, while `self` refers to the just the instance

`Self` refers to the type of the current "thing" inside of a protocol (whatever is conforming to the protocol). For an example of its use, see Protocol func returning Self.
