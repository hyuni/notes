# fluent interface

from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface)

In software engineering, a fluent interface (as first coined by Eric Evans and
Martin Fowler) is a method for constructing object oriented APIs, where the
readability of the source code is close to that of ordinary written prose.
