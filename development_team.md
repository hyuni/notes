# Managing Your Developer Account Team

If you have an organization membership in the Apple Developer Program, you can add people to your team and assign them roles, thereby granting them levels of access to team assets. Team members have roles and privileges that pertain to the development and distribution process. These roles define who is allowed to enable certain app services, who is allowed to create identifiers, who is allowed to create distribution assets, and so on. After adding team members, you may be responsible for performing other tasks on their behalf. For example, you may need to enable capabilities for the App ID and create client SSL certificates for APNs, Pass Type IDs, and iCloud containers. If you’re enrolled in the Apple Developer Program as an individual, team management tasks described in this chapter don’t apply.
