# Volume

exists on the logical level of the OS.

In computer data storage, a volume or logical drive is a single accessible
storage area with a single file system, typically (though not necessarily)
resident on a single partition of a hard disk. Although a volume might be
different from a physical disk drive, it can still be accessed with an operating
system's logical interface. However, a volume differs from a partition.

## Partitions
Volumes aren't the same as partitions. Partitions are on the physical level, and volumes are on the logical level.
