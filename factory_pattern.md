# Factory

essentially an object for creating other objects. Different than an `init` in
that you can vary the type of the object that you get back.

In object-oriented programming (OOP), a factory is an object for creating other
objects â€“ formally a factory is a function or method that returns objects of a
varying prototype or class[1] from some method call, which is assumed to be
"new". More broadly, a subroutine that returns a "new" object may be referred
to as a "factory", as in factory method or factory function. This is a basic
concept in OOP, and forms the basis for a number of related software design
patterns.

In class-based programming, a factory is an abstraction of a constructor of a
class, while in prototype-based programming a factory is an abstraction of a
prototype object. A constructor is concrete in that it creates objects as
instances of a single class, and by a specified process (class instantiation),
while a factory can create objects by instantiating various classes, or by using
other allocation schemes such as an object pool. A prototype object is concrete
in that it is used to create objects by being cloned, while a factory can create
objects by cloning various prototypes, or by other allocation schemes.
