# Homebrew

* Homebrew installs packages to their own directory and then symlinks their files
into /usr/local.

## Cask

`brew cask` is an extension to brew that allows management of graphical
applications through the Cask project.

## Taps

`brew tap` adds more repositories to the list of formulae that brew tracks,
updates, and installs from. By default, tap assumes that the repositories come
from GitHub, but the command isnâ€™t limited to any one location.

## Bottles

binary packages

## Cellar

where the kegs are installed, ie `/usr/local/Cellar`

## Kegs

the install prefix of a formula

### keg-only

For a software to be "keg-only" means it is installed in `/usr/local/Cellar` but
not linked into places like `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/local/lib`, etc. That means
other software that depends on it has to be compiled with specific instructions
to use the files in `/usr/local/Cellar`. That's done automatically by brew
install when a formula specifies keg-only dependencies.

## Formula

The package definition

### `brew udpate`

updates `brew` itself

### upgrade a formula version
```bash
brew upgrade <my-favorite-formula>
```

### check version of formula
```bash
brew list --versions | ack ${formula}
```

### install specific version
```bash
brew switch <formula> <version>
```

### info on formula
```bash
brew info <version>
```

### install older version not on your machine
