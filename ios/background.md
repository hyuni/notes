# Background

* from [here](https://www.raywenderlich.com/890-background-modes-tutorial-getting-started)

Your app is only allowed to keep running in the background in very specific
cases.

these include:  
* playing audio,
* getting location updates
* fetching the latest content from a server.
* Perform finite-length tasks: the generic “whatever” case, where the app can run
arbitrary code for a limited amount of time.
