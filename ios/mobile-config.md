A configuration profile is an XML file that allows you to distribute
configuration information to iOS-based devices. If you need to configure a large
number of devices or to provide lots of custom email settings, network settings,
or certificates to a large number of devices, configuration profiles are an easy
way to do it.

An iOS configuration profile contains a number of settings that you can specify, including:

* Passcode policies
* Restrictions on device features (disabling the camera, for example)
* Wi-Fi settings
* VPN settings
* Email server settings
* Exchange settings
* LDAP directory service settings
* CalDAV calendar service settings
* Web clips
* Credentials and keys
* Advanced cellular network settings
