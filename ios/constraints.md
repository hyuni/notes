# `NSLayoutConstraint`

A constraint defines a relationship between two user interface objects that must be satisfied by the constraint-based layout system. Each constraint is a linear equation with the following format:

```
item1.attribute1 = multiplier Ã— item2.attribute2 + constant
```

# `NSLayoutAnchor`

The `NSLayoutAnchor` class is a factory class for creating `NSLayoutConstraint` objects using a fluent API. Use these constraints to programatically define your layout using Auto Layout.

# `NSLayoutYAxisAnchor`

# `NSLayoutDimension`
A factory class for creating size-based layout constraint objects using a fluent API.



# `UILayoutGuide`
A rectangular area that can interact with Auto Layout.

Use layout guides to replace the dummy views you may have created to represent
inter-view spaces or encapsulation in your user interface. Traditionally, there
were a number of Auto Layout techniques that required dummy views.
