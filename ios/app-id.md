# App ID

from [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Conceptual/DevPedia-CocoaCore/AppID.html)

`Team ID` - generated by Apple

`Bundle ID` - Bundle ID search string (supplied by you)

`App ID` = `Team ID` + `Bundle ID`

## Explicit App IDs
For an explicit `App ID` to match an app, the `Team ID` in the `App ID` must equal
the `Team ID` associated with the app, and the `bundle ID` search string must equal
the `bundle ID` for the app. The `bundle ID` is a unique identifier that identifies
a single app and cannot be used by other teams.


## Wildcard App IDs
For a wildcard `App ID` to match an app, the `Team ID` must match exactly and the
`bundle ID` must match the `bundle ID` search string using the wildcard matching
rules.
