* from [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/Size-ClassSpecificLayout.html)

* Interface Builder recognizes nine different size classes.

## Final size classes:
The Final classes represent actual size classes displayed on devices.
  * Compact-Compact,
  * Compact-Regular,
  * Regular-Compact, and
  * Regular-Regular.

## Base size classes:
These are abstract size classes that represent two or
more Final size classes. For example, items installed in the Compact-Any size
class appear in both the Compact-Compact and Compact-Regular size views.

* Compact-Any,
* Regular-Any,
* Any-Compact,
* Any-Regular, and
* Any-Any.
