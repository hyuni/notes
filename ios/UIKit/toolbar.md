# Toolbar

A toolbar usually appears at the bottom of a screen, and displays one or more
buttons called toolbar items. Generally, these buttons provide some sort of tool
that is relevant to the screenâ€™s current content. A toolbar is often used in
conjunction with a navigation controller, which manages both the navigation bar
and the toolbar.
