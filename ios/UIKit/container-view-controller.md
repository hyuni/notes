# Container View Controller

Container view controllers are a way to combine the content from multiple view
controllers into a single user interface. Container view controllers are most
often used to facilitate navigation and to create new user interface types based
on existing content. Examples of container view controllers in UIKit include
`UINavigationController`, `UITabBarController`, and `UISplitViewController`, all of
which facilitate navigation between different parts of your user interface.

The only requirement from `UIKit` is that you establish a formal parent-child
relationship between the container view controller and any child view
controllers.
