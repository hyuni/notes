# Entitlements

* Entitlements confer specific capabilities or security permissions to your iOS or macOS app.

You can set many entitlements:
* using the Summary tab of the Xcode target editor.
* Other entitlements require editing a targetâ€™s entitlements property list file.
* Finally, a few entitlements are inherited from the iOS provisioning profile used to run the app.
