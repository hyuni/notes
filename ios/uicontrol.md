# UIControl

The base class for controls, which are visual elements that convey a specific
action or intention in response to user interactions.

```
Inherits From

## `UIControlState`
A control can have more than one state at a time. Controls can be configured
differently based on their state. For example, a `UIButton` object can be
configured to display one image when it is in its normal state and a different
image when it is highlighted.
