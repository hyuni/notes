* logging

## log levels

### verbose
The lowest priority level. Use this one for contextual information.
### debug
Use this level for printing variables and results that will help you fix a bug or solve a problem.
### info
This is typically used for information useful in a more general support context. In other words, info that is useful for non developers looking into issues.
### warning
Use this log level when reaching a condition that wonâ€™t necessarily cause a problem but strongly leads the app in that direction.
### error
The most serious and highest priority log level. Use this only when your app has triggered a serious error.
