# Locale

`Locale` encapsulates information about linguistic, cultural, and technological
conventions and standards. Examples of information encapsulated by a locale
include the symbol used for the decimal separator in numbers and the way dates
are formatted.

`Locales` are typically used to provide, format, and interpret information about
and according to the userâ€™s customs and preferences. They are frequently used in
conjunction with formatters. Although you can use many locales, you usually use
the one associated with the current user.
