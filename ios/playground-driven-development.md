# Playground Driven Development

## Design goals
* use app code in app
* use app code in playground
* quick iteration
* experiment with actual application code
* easy movement of code from playground to application


## Setup Theory
* create Cocoa Touch framework
* embed app code in it
* import the framework into the App Target, and use it in the app delegate
* import the framework into the playground, and use it there.
