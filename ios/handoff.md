# Handoff

[programming guide](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204681)

Handoff lets users switch from one device to another and continue an ongoing
activity seamlessly, without reconfiguring each device independently. For
example, a user who is browsing a long article in Safari on a Mac can move to a
nearby iOS device thatâ€™s signed into iCloud with the same Apple ID and open the
same webpage automatically in Safari on iOS, at the same scroll position as on
the original device.
