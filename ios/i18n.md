## Base Internationalization
Base internationalization separates user-facing strings from `.storyboard` and
`.xib` files. It relieves localizers of the need to modify `.storyboard` and
`.xib` files in Interface Builder. Instead, an app has just one set of
`.storyboard` and `.xib` files where strings are in the development language—the
language that you used to create the `.storyboard` and `.xib` files. These
`.storyboard` and `.xib` files are called the base internationalization. When
you export localizations, the development language strings are the source that
is translated into multiple languages. When you import localizations, Xcode
generates language-specific strings files for each `.storyboard` and `.xib`
file. The strings files don’t appear in the project navigator until you import
localizations or add languages.
