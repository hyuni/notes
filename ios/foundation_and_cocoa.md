# Foundation

The Foundation framework provides a base layer of functionality for apps and frameworks, including data storage and persistence, text processing, date and time calculations, sorting and filtering, and networking. The classes, protocols, and data types defined by Foundation are used throughout the macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS SDKs.


# Core Foundation

* C code

Core Foundation is a library with a set of programming interfaces conceptually
derived from the Objective-C-based Foundation framework but implemented in the C
language. To do this, Core Foundation implements a limited object model in C.
Core Foundation defines opaque types that encapsulate data and functions,
hereafter referred to as “objects.”

Access low-level functions, primitive data types, and various collection types that are bridged seamlessly with the Foundation framework.

Core Foundation is a framework that provides fundamental software services useful to application services, application environments, and to applications themselves. Core Foundation also provides abstractions for common data types, facilitates internationalization with Unicode string storage, and offers a suite of utilities such as plug-in support, XML property lists, URL resource access, and preferences.

includes Foundation and UIKit... not sure it matters
