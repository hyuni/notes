A string that has associated attributes (such as visual style, hyperlinks, or
accessibility data) for portions of its text.

An `NSAttributedString` object manages character strings and associated sets of
attributes (for example, font and kerning) that apply to individual characters
or ranges of characters in the string. An association of characters and their
attributes is called an attributed string. The clusterâ€™s two public classes,
`NSAttributedString` and `NSMutableAttributedString`, declare the programmatic
interface for read-only attributed strings and modifiable attributed strings,
respectively.
