# music file formats

## m4a
Audio-only MPEG-4 files generally have a .m4a extension. This is especially true of non-protected content.

## m4p
MPEG-4 files with audio streams encrypted by FairPlay Digital Rights Management as were sold through the iTunes Store use the .m4p extension. iTunes Plus tracks, that the iTunes Store currently sells, are unencrypted and use .m4a accordingly.
