# match

A new approach to iOS code signing: Share one code signing identity across your development team to simplify your codesigning setup and prevent code signing issues.

match is the implementation of the https://codesigning.guide concept. match creates all required certificates & provisioning profiles and stores them in a separate git repository. Every team member with access to the repo can use those credentials for code signing. match also automatically repairs broken and expired credentials. It's the easiest way to share signing credentials across teams.
