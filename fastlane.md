# match

A new approach to iOS code signing: Share one code signing identity across your
development team to simplify your codesigning setup and prevent code signing
issues.

match is the implementation of the https://codesigning.guide concept. match
creates all required certificates & provisioning profiles and stores them in a
separate git repository. Every team member with access to the repo can use those
credentials for code signing. match also automatically repairs broken and
expired credentials. It's the easiest way to share signing credentials across
teams.
