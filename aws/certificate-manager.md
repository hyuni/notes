* acts as Certificate Authority?

AWS Certificate Manager is a service that lets you easily provision, manage, and
deploy Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) certificates for
use with AWS services. SSL/TLS certificates are used to secure network
communications and establish the identity of websites over the Internet. AWS
Certificate Manager removes the time-consuming manual process of purchasing,
uploading, and renewing SSL/TLS certificates. With AWS Certificate Manager, you
can quickly request a certificate, deploy it on AWS resources such as Elastic
Load Balancers, Amazon CloudFront distributions, and APIs on API Gateway, and
let AWS Certificate Manager handle certificate renewals. SSL/TLS certificates
provisioned through AWS Certificate Manager are free. You pay only for the AWS
resources you create to run your application.
