# API Gateway

from [here](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/)

Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers
to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. With a few
clicks in the AWS Management Console, you can create an API that acts as a
“front door” for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality
from your back-end services, such as workloads running on Amazon Elastic Compute
Cloud (Amazon EC2), code running on AWS Lambda, or any Web application. Amazon
API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to
hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management,
authorization and access control, monitoring, and API version management. Amazon
API Gateway has no minimum fees or startup costs. You pay only for the API calls
you receive and the amount of data transferred out.
