# Dates

## UTC

### offset
A time offset is an amount of time subtracted from or added to Coordinated
Universal Time (UTC) time to get the current civil time, whether it is standard
time or daylight saving time (DST).

## ISO8601
In representations for interchange, dates and times are arranged so the largest
temporal term (the year) is placed to the left and each successively smaller
term is placed to the right of the previous term. Representations must be
written in a combination of Arabic numerals and certain characters (such as "-", ":",
"T", "W", and "Z") that are given specific meanings within the standard; the
implication is that some commonplace ways of writing parts of dates, such as
"January" or "Thursday", are not allowed in interchange representations.
