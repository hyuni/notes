# `rbenv`

* from [here](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)

Use `rbenv` to pick a Ruby version for your application and guarantee that your
development environment matches production. Put `rbenv` to work with `Bundler` for
painless Ruby upgrades and bulletproof deployments.

* uses the `$PATH` to look for a ruby executable

* more lightweight in comparision to `RVM`
