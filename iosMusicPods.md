Looking for a resource to display musical notation in iOS. Want the ability to show notes(s) on a staff, and an API that updates a view for specific notes.

I searched around and found these possibilities.

open source app for mananiging sheet music, etc. open source code might be useful to see if/how they generate their sheet music
