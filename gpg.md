# Pretty Good Privacy ("PGP")

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy

Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is an encryption program that provides cryptographic
privacy and authentication for data communication. PGP is used for signing,
encrypting, and decrypting texts, e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk
partitions and to increase the security of e-mail communications. Phil
Zimmermann developed PGP in 1991.[2]

PGP and similar software follow the OpenPGP standard (RFC 4880) for encrypting
and decrypting data.
