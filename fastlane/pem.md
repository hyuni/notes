# `fastlane pem`

`pem` does all that for you, just by simply running pem.

`pem` creates new `.pem`, `.cer`, and `.p12` files to be uploaded to your push
server if a valid push notification profile is needed. `pem` does not cover
uploading the file to your server.

To automate iOS Provisioning profiles you can use `match`.
